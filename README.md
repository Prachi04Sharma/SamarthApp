# SAMARTH App: Neurological Assessment Platform

## Overview
SAMARTH is a comprehensive neurological assessment web platform designed to monitor and evaluate symptoms of various neurological conditions including Bell's Palsy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's Disease. The platform utilizes computer vision, machine learning, signal processing techniques, and AI analysis to assess neuromotor function through various specialized tests.
